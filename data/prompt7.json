          "tactics": "Magna should counter this by claiming 'Integration Mastery'â€”the ability to seamlessly connect all the disparate systems (the 'body') to create a superior, cohesive, and functioning whole. The narrative shifts from being a single 'brain' to being the master orchestrator of an entire, complex system."

          "tactics": "Magna's 'Creator' archetype provides a powerful differentiation point. Instead of just offering 'solutions,' Magna should focus its narrative on 'co-creation.' It should emphasize imagination, partnership, and building the future together with its customers, which is a significant contrast to the authoritative Sage tone."

          "tactics": "Magna must urgently elevate its SDV narrative. The brand must move from general statements to specific, high-impact claims, showcasing tangible SDV partnerships and solutions to match Bosch's authority. This requires a dedicated content strategy focused on SDV."

        "recommendation": "Magna's low confidence ratio (2.5:1) is a significant vulnerability. The brand must calibrate its language to be more assertive and confident.
