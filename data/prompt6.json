    "identifiedGaps": {
      "positioningWhitespace": "No brand has a strong, defensible positioning around **Integration Leadership** or **Manufacturing Intelligence** as their primary claim. Most are focused on being 'full-service providers' or 'system architects,' but no one has claimed the specific territory of being the master integrator of a broad, complex portfolio. Magna is uniquely positioned to claim this space.",
      "valuePropositionGaps": "The market is saturated with promises of 'sustainability,' 'innovation,' and 'safety.' The gaps lie in articulating a value proposition around **Technology Democratization**—making advanced, complex technology accessible and adaptable for a wider range of partners, not just the top-tier OEMs.",
      "tonalTerritoryOpportunities": "While many brands use a 'Sage' (authoritative, expert) tone, there is a significant opportunity for a more **Creator**-driven, energetic, and imaginative tone. Gentex uses this partially, but a large-scale, consistent, and confident Creator tone is unclaimed. This is Magna's archetype and a major opportunity.",
      "archetypeCombinationsUnused": "The combination of the **Creator** archetype with a **Caregiver** or **Jester** archetype is almost entirely unused. Brands are either innovative (Creator/Sage) or reliable (Caregiver/Ruler). A brand that is both a Creator and a collaborative partner (Caregiver) has a major whitespace advantage.",
      "uniqueValuesUnclaimed": "The value of **systemic thinking** (Magna's opportunity) is unclaimed. Other brands talk about 'ecosystems' or 'platforms,' but none explicitly position themselves as the masters of integrating disparate technologies into a cohesive, functional system.",
      "narrativeAnglesAvailable": "The narrative of **'The Collaborative Creator'**—a brand that partners with others to create the future, rather than just dictating it—is available. This angle would combine Magna's Creator archetype with a more engaging, partner-centric tone.",
      "underservedPersonas": "Critical audiences like **Software Developers**, **Data Scientists**, and **City Planners** are largely ignored in favor of traditional B2B personas like 'OEM Executives' and 'Automotive Engineers'."
