MASTER PROMPT 3: Strategic Analysis & Tensions Platform (ENHANCED)
Using the 10 brand reports, create a React dashboard page titled "Humanbrand AI: Magna International Outside-In Brand Perception (Website)" covering deliverables 15-19 with PATTERN ANALYSIS.

REACT ARCHITECTURE:

- Dark UI: #222428 background, #FAFAFA text
- Highlight Magna in RED #E22E2F
- Use recharts for all visualizations
- lucide-react for navigation and actions
- Green #8FFF00 for opportunities, #DA6E44 for tensions

BUILD THESE COMPONENTS: 15. Narrative Coherence Scorecard (ALL tensions displayed) 16. Audience Persona Network (ALL personas interactive) 17. Portfolio Architecture Comparison (complete descriptions) 18. Brand Architecture Analysis (master vs. sub-brands) 19. Key Business Drivers Priority Matrix (ALL drivers with evidence)

ENHANCED ANALYTICAL COMPONENTS:

20. COMPETITIVE TENSION ANALYZER

- Tension Pattern Matrix showing:
  - 80% have "Heritage vs. Future" - implications
  - 60% have "Breadth vs. Specialization"
  - Magna's specific tension profile vs. competitors
- Resolution strategies used by successful brands
- Learn from high-coherence brands (Lear, Aptiv)
- Tension severity scoring

21. UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATOR MATRIX

- Each brand's singular claim that no one else makes
- Aptiv: "Brain and nervous system" metaphor
- Gentex: Local community focus
- Lear: Two-pillar simplicity
- Magna: Integration capability (show as underutilized)
- Defensibility assessment for each

22. COHERENCE BENCHMARKING TOOL

- Magna vs. best-in-class coherence scores
- Specific improvement opportunities
- Learn from Lear's high coherence approach
- Tension resolution best practices

23. STRATEGIC TENSION PATTERN INSIGHTS

- Common tension heat map (what % share which tensions)
- Industry-wide implications
- Magna's advantage/disadvantage from each tension
- Priority resolution order

RECHARTS VISUALIZATIONS:

- Sankey diagram for tensions flow
- Force-directed graph for personas
- TreeMap for portfolio complexity
- Stacked bar for architecture types
- Scatter plot for driver priorities
- Heat map for tension patterns

CRITICAL FEATURES:

- Display ALL strategic tensions exactly as stated
- Interactive persona cards with relationships
- Filterable business driver table
- Comparative coherence view
- Magna entries always highlighted in RED #E22E2F

No summarization - complete findings only.
